    # Introduction
    The Money Transfer Customer Online (aka MTC) REST API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTFul. It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use MTC's APIs. 
    
    The API is offered as SaaS platform, that is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted
    
    # Who we are? 
    
    Grey Systems is a well establish European IT Consulting company that specialises in working with financial institutions. 

    During the last years, we have developed "Push Money"â€‹, a next level technology platform to provide instant online multichannel money transfer services and other financial services and products, outside of conventional banking channels.
    
    Our clients are international MTO's and MNO's that demand solid Fintech expertise for their business operations.
    
    Grey Systems is the best professional IT answer to real time remittance companies.
    
    
    # Goal 
    
    The goal of the API is provide an API for customers to interact with the MTC Systems. This means that the API is intended to by used directly by customers, so all the operations assume that a customer is logged in the system, and will provide information based on that assumption. 
    
    This means that there is no possibility through this MTC Online REST API to query for information at other leven than the customer level, for instance, this API does not offer any method to provide reporting for all customers within a `PartnerSystem`. Please contact GreySystems teams for additional API  
  
    
    # Authentication
    
    All MTC APIs, including this one, use [OpenId Connect](http://openid.net) protocol to authenticate users. 
    
    To authenticate your customers agains MTC system, please ask GreySystems for detailed information about the `OpenId` configuration of your account. 
    
    Once you have access to our `OpenId` authorization server, you will have the possibility of using any `OpenId` client library to get a [JWT](https://jwt.io) token that need to be set on every HTTP call to the API in the header `Authorization` of the request as `Authorization: bearer {the jwt access token}`
    
    # Common HTTP Error Responses
    
    The MTC Rest API uses the following common HTTP status codes to communicate general issues or errors to the clients: 
    
    * HTTP  **401** (Non authorized): The token provided is expired, inexistent or non-valid
    * HTTP **403** (Forbidden): The customer is not allowed to perform the call
    * HTTP **400** (Invalid Request): The request provided is invalid (request is not well formed, a mandatory field is not provided, etc..). 
    * HTTP **500** (Internal Server Error): Some internal component has failed to process your request. Please notify about this error to GreySystems team.

      summary: Sends a transfer
      description: Operation to send a transfer to the system. The mandatory information of the request can be found in the SendTransferRequest data scheme. However please take into account that depending on the configuration requested to GreySystems, additional fields can be marked as mandatory, and thus the system can reject a transfer if some mandatory fields are not provided (as 400 HTTP error). <br><br> Compliance Considerations<br><br> When some compliance rule is broken, an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error is returned with information about what specific rule has been broken , and additional information of the broken rule, so that the customer can ammend the transfer (if possible) to then send money. <br><br> Send operation is 100% stateless, this means that you as a caller, can retry the operation after ammend it, and the system will only store the transfer just in case all compliance rules are valid.
